;0x1869CCD3=A homeless Vietnam veteran, Jerry Kapowitz, has stumbled upon a haul of diamonds valued at over $2 million. They were in a small pouch amongst the trash in Meadows Park. Mr. Kapowitz had been living near the dump and surviving off of things he salvaged from there. "Before this, the best thing I'd found was a TV and that didn't even work," he told reporters. Mr. Kapowitz plans to take his newfound wealth down to Vice City where he will start a gun shop and liquor store, "They're real men down there and they need real guns and liquor in one convenient location." Mr. Kapowitz's ownership of the diamonds was immediately contested by over 100 people. Mayor Ochoa decided that it would be impossible to verify the claims so allowed Mr. Kapowitz to keep all of the proceeds from the diamonds' sale.
0x1869CCD3=一位无家可归的越战老兵杰里·卡波维茨偶然发现了一批价值超过200万美元的钻石。他们在草地公园的垃圾堆里的一个小袋子里。卡波维茨先生一直住在垃圾场附近，靠从那里打捞的东西过活。”在这之前，我找到的最好的东西就是一台电视，它甚至都是坏的，”他告诉记者。卡波维茨计划把他新发现的财富带到罪恶都市，在那里他将开一家枪械店和酒类商店，“他们是真正的勇士，他们需要在一个方便的地方有真正的枪械和酒。”卡波维茨对钻石的所有权立即遭到100多人的争夺。奥乔亚市长决定不可能核实这些说法，因此允许卡波维茨保留出售钻石所得的全部收入。

;0x74693DD5=Mob Boss, Jon Gravelli, alleged head of the Gambetti crime family, died peacefully in his sleep last night. Mr. Gravelli, 85, had been residing at the Schottler Medical Center for the last 3 years. Although some in the DA's office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty.
0x74693DD5=暴徒头目Jon Gravelli，据称是Gambetti犯罪家族的头目，昨晚在睡梦中安然去世。85岁的Gravelli先生在Schottler医疗中心居住了3年。尽管检察官办公室的一些人辩称，这是一个逃避法庭诉讼的诡计，但格拉夫利在入院后从未离开过医院。格拉夫利先生自1978年起担任甘贝蒂犯罪集团的头目，在他的领导下，这个家族已经成为自由城犯罪家族中最强大的一个，与帕瓦诺家族不相上下。尽管格拉夫利先生被起诉过好几次，但他从未被判重罪。一些人认为，他在政府内部有保护他的联系人，他会让犯罪同伙为他进行打击和其他犯罪活动，但这些指控从未得到证实。自由城犯罪团伙之间微妙的权力平衡现在发生了什么还不得而知。这些不太可能被公布。

;0xD8EFD2CA=Authorities and pundits are looking for the meanings behind two gangland shootouts that broke out in the city. Several Russian gangsters thought to be involved in a major heroin deal were killed in Hove Beach. Shortly afterwards, a shootout broke out at Francis International Terminal, culminating in the crashing of a private jet belonging to controversial Russian business man Ray Bulgarin.
0xD8EFD2CA=当局和权威人士正在寻找这座城市发生的两起黑社会枪击案背后的含义。几名被认为与海洛因交易有关的俄罗斯匪徒在霍夫海滩被杀。不久后，弗朗西斯国际航站楼爆发枪战，最终导致一架属于有争议的俄罗斯商人Ray Bulgarin的私人飞机坠毁。

;0xEB2F7715=Attempting to read the tea leaves, as it were, authorities are asking whether this spells a resurgence in violent organised crime in the city, or perhaps its death knell. Are the numbers of these Russian criminals sustainable or will this infighting mean that they eventually become extinct? We shall see, but we certainly like the metaphor. Makes us look Darwinian.
0xEB2F7715=当局试图解读茶叶的原貌，并询问这是否意味着该市暴力有组织犯罪活动的死灰复燃，或者可能是死亡的丧钟。这些俄罗斯罪犯的数量是可持续的还是这场内讧意味着他们最终会灭绝？我们会明白的，但我们当然喜欢这个比喻。使我们看起来像达尔文主义者。
