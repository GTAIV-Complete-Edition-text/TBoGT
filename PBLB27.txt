;0xBF54ABC2=Sweatshops. That's what the ragged, broken American college student finds when they hit the workforce. Fresh out of college, a place of learning, they want time to balance life by taking long hikes, getting colon cleansing, writing in a journal! How do we expect people to be part of a democracy when they are bogged down by oppressive work 8-9 hours a day? We feel sad for Sandra McColland, she's standing up for herself and fighting corporate America. Good for you. You go girl. These conservatives will take every ounce of your being. Sue them till they get a clue that work is about more than working.
0xBF54ABC2=血汗工厂。这正是衣衫褴褛、支离破碎的美国大学生在就业时的发现。刚从大学毕业，从一个学习的地方出来，他们希望有时间通过长途远足，清洗结肠，写日记来平衡生活！当人们为每天8-9小时的压迫性工作不堪重负时，我们如何期望他们成为民主的一部分？我们为桑德拉·麦考兰感到难过，她在为自己而战，为美国企业而战。真为你高兴。去吧，女孩。这些保守派会夺走你的一切。起诉他们直到他们知道工作不仅仅是工作。
