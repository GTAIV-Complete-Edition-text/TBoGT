;0x3EBBF831=Pressing the wrong button on his phone may cost him millions of dollars as fans react to the scandalous shots of boy band superstar Bobby Blue in women's lingerie posing and mugging in the mirror. Mr. Blue initially claimed it was a digitally altered photo that had been sent out by a rival boy band. Now he's confessed all and says he dressed up for a funny shoot for their next video. However, industry insiders say they haven't had a plan for a video shoot in months.

;0x746C2893=You may have heard the nonsense coming out of Switzerland this week - no, not their claims that pocket knives and watches are a really important contribution to global culture - but the economists' summit that declared the recession is in fact just a myth. Millions of Americans disagree - in fact one in 7 does so because they're unemployed. Economists are idiots who sit around drawing graphs and getting aroused at comparing GDP numbers from year to year. They were dorks at school who still cannot get laid. We say - Babylon is burning, and nobody cares except a few of us journalists left since all the papers have gone down the shitter. I was an intern last week and now I'm Sr. Economics editor. Journalism is screwed. Big shout outs to my boys Javier and Jason. You know how we do it in Bohan, son! Peace!
0x746C2893=你可能听过本周瑞士传出的胡言乱语——不，不是他们声称袖珍刀和手表对全球文化的贡献真的很重要——但宣布经济衰退的经济学家峰会实际上只是一个神话。数以百万计的美国人不同意-事实上，七分之一的人这样做是因为他们失业了。经济学家都是白痴，他们无所事事地画图表，在比较一年一年的GDP数据时被激起兴趣。他们是学校里的呆子，还不能下床。我们说-巴比伦正在燃烧，没有人关心，除了我们几个记者离开了，因为所有的报纸都已走入垃圾。我上周是个实习生，现在是高级经济编辑。新闻业被搞砸了。对我儿子哈维尔和杰森大喊大叫。你知道我们在博汉是怎么做到的，孩子！和平！

Having been accused at various points of arms dealing, drug trafficking, slave trading, incest, and supporting repressive regimes, some will not mourn his passing, but many in government enjoyed vacations at his ranch and hunting endangered species on his farm.
0xAC0938BE=Van Hardenburg先生受到一些人的爱戴和许多人的憎恨，人们指责他参与了各种各样的邪恶活动。由于在多个方面被指控从事军火交易、贩毒、贩卖奴隶、乱伦和支持专制政权，一些人不会为他的去世而哀悼，但许多政府官员在他的牧场享受假期，并在他的农场猎杀濒危物种。
