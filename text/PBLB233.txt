;0x1E934DE3=How did we get here? The family dentist has become a creep. A drug dealer. A lecher. And despite most of us having dental insurance, each visit costs us a fortune. It came to a head recently with Simon Epstein, the so called Dirty Dentist, a sad case which sheds a light on a profession that needs to be regulated. Our children go to these creeps. Who knows what these guys are doing to my teen daughter while I'm in the waiting room thumbing through some idiotic right wing magazine? Epstein, it has been claimed, also used to masturbate his patients to relax them during root canals. It's sick, and the conservatives have deregulated our country to such an extent that this kind of thing goes on, unimpeded by the state.
0x1E934DE3=为什么会变成这样呢？家庭牙医现在成了变态、毒贩、淫魔的代名词。尽管大多数人都有牙科保险，但每次看牙医还是要花上一大笔钱。近日，「龌龊牙医」Simon Epstein的事件引起轩然大波，致使要求监管牙医行业的呼声日益高涨。我们的孩子要去找这些变态看牙，而我只能在候诊室里翻阅右翼的傻逼杂志，鬼知道这些变态在对我的小公主做什么啊？据说为了让病人放松下来，Epstein会在根管治疗时给病人撸上一管。太恶心了。这种龌龊牙医能在国内畅行无阻，是保守派的松懈管制让国家成了这个样子。
