0x019DB7CB=这里的生活还是老样子。人们吵来吵去，农场各种状况。我们交税建造新的国会大厦，养着那些公务员，自己的生活倒还是那么贫困。对乡下人来说，在哪过日子都一样。请给我回信。

;0x299299E2=Dear mother, thanks for your mail. Life in America is okay, thank you for your concern. I wish Roman would join me from his time spent living in clouds. He makes things up, I don't know why. He has a nice woman in his life, that is true, the rest is lies. Apart from Florian Cravic. We have seen him. He is very different.
0x299299E2=亲爱的妈妈，谢谢你的来信。我在美国的生活还好，多谢你的关心。希望Roman能离开他的幻想国度，回到现实中来。也不知道为什么，他就喜欢胡扯。他是找到了一个好女人，这句没错，剩下都是编的。我们也见到Florian Cravic了，他变化好大。

;0x2A2F88EE=I was thinking about you, and I thought I write. I receive nice e mail from your cousin. He say you had seen Florian Cravic again. Did he become a professional wrestler, as he say? He was always strange boy. Roman also tells me he has woman nice in his life and that maybe there was someone special for you too. Life here is much same - crops grow,
0x2A2F88EE=刚才在想你的事，我就把想法都写下来了。我收到了你堂兄的邮件，他说你已经见到Florian Cravic了。他有实现职业摔跤手之梦吗？这孩子一直都有点怪。Roman跟我说他找到了一个好女人，还说你也已经有了人选。这里的生活变化不大，我们种种庄稼，

;0x4E551A97=He is not a professional wrestler, but I get the sense he still likes to wrestle with men as keen amateur. We have met many people, but most of them have little power and are controlled only by money. Life is strange here. One friend of Roman's likes to inject himself with shark testosterone. These are the kind of people we know here.
0x4E551A97=他不是职业摔跤手，但我觉得他还是愿意作为业余爱好者跟别人摔跤的。我们是遇到了很多人，但他们大多没什么能力，眼睛里只有钱。这里的生活很奇怪，Roman的一个朋友还喜欢给自己打牛鲨睾酮。我们认识的就是这几种人。

Life always confusing uncertain. Only problems change. We have never known freedom, and nor democracy. Sometimes, I think this makes realist life easier for us.
0x508DD5AA=国家原地踏步，英国人来这里买一辈子都不会住的度假屋，政治家各执己见。我们都希望情况能有所改变。我还记得以前的事，人生就是迷离又充满变数的，只是遇到的问题不同。我们不知道什么自由，也不知道民主。有时我觉得这样反倒让我们生活得更加轻松。

;0x623D2253=Dear mother, thank you for your e mail. I am always happy to hear from you. I am sorry I have not been much of a son to you, and that I am not there to take care of you, but you know I cannot come back home. It would bring trouble, and unhappy memories for both of us. Roman is well. He is living the American dream, mostly in his head, like all dreams.
0x623D2253=亲爱的妈妈，谢谢你的来信。我总是期待着你给我写信的。很对不起，儿子没能为你尽孝，也没能在家照顾你。但你也知道，我不能回家。回来的话会有人找我麻烦的，还可能让我们想起那些不快的回忆。Roman他很好，他正活在想象中的美国梦里，黄粱一梦。

0x681B04B8=Nadam se da si dobro i da si srecan u Americi (愿你在美国一切顺利)。希望你能收到这封邮件，再给我回个信。我很想你。Roman告诉我他现在只会英语了，你应该也差不多吧，所以这封信是用英语写的。我知道你离开家乡会过得更好，但我依然想你。思念游子是母亲的责任。你不在船上干了吗？你是想就此留在外面的世界，还是回到故乡？你还会回到我身边吗？一想到你跟你堂兄一起，在美国过着好日子，我就很高兴；
