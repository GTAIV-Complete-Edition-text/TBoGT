            "original": "The military industrial complex claims another victim. Notorious agent of death, Frickie van Hardenburg was killed yesterday, seemingly in the middle of an arms deal. Having only just been allowed a visa to enter the country, the slave trader and arms dealer that human rights groups have been trying to put on trial was himself the victim of horrific violence, after a bloody attack by an unknown assailant on his boat, seemingly killing all on board. This is the kind of violence we expect when the government cares more about weapons than health care. Mr. van Hardenburg who saw himself as a legitimate businessman, but who had links to countless repressive regimes in Africa and the Middle East, and who has been implicated in slave trading in Asia, along with diamond dealing and above all weapons smuggling into conflicts across the globe, was a popular guest of several Senators, who will no doubt mourn his passing and the healthy campaign donations he made.",
            "translated": "军工复合体再次带来死亡。臭名昭著的死亡使者Frickie Van Hardenburg于昨日遇害，遇害时他似乎在进行军火交易。不久前这个军火商兼奴隶贩子才获批签证，引起国内人权组织声讨。如今他也成了骇人暴力的受害者，在自己的船上遭到神秘杀手袭击，船上乘客似乎无一幸免。在政府更加关心军火、忽视医保的当下，这种暴力很难不让人拍手称快。Van Hardenburg先生自视为遵纪守法的商人，却与非洲和中东地区的专制政权眉来眼去，与亚洲的奴隶贩子暗通款曲，他还涉足血钻走私和全球冲突地区的军火偷运。不仅如此，他还是我国好几位参议员的座上宾朋，想必这几位参议员一定会为他的死亡与先前提供的政治献金感到无比的悲痛。",
