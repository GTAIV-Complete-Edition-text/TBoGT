;0x2A93A1C7=President Lawton has delivered on his promise and the country is finally out of the recession. Business and politicians celebrated yesterday as the dark days are behind us. Liberal media outlets will tout false stats about unemployment, but don't believe a bunch of lazy bums who are trying to hold this country back. We at Weazel applaud the President and our conservative members of Congress who made this happen.
