;0x1CA183EA=While no ransom demands have been delivered yet, the mayor expects this incident to be in line with other recent piracy around the world.

0x1CA183EA=虽然尚未收到赎金要求，但市长预计这次事件将与最近世界各地的其他海盗事件一样。在这一年里，北海的一个石油钻井平台被盗，新加坡的一整栋摩天大楼失踪。现在人们觉得没有任何地方可以免遭海盗毒手。

;0x31CCAE40=From the coast of East Africa to the shores of the Humboldt River, pirates have become the principal menace to twenty first century commuters. In one of the most daring steals of the last few months, a band of pirates have stolen a subway car in Broker. Bystanders report a "dusky" looking man climbing along the roof of the train and unhooking it before it was pulled into the air by a Skylift. Authorities lost track of the car and Skylift as it disappeared behind a building.
0x31CCAE40=从东非海岸到Humboldt河沿岸，海盗已经成为21世纪上班族的主要威胁。日前一伙海盗在Broker偷了一节地铁车厢，这是过去几个月里最大胆的劫案之一。据目击者称，一名「黑不溜秋」的男子爬上列车车顶，脱开车钩，车厢随后被一架吊挂直升机拉入空中。拉着车厢的直升机在绕到一栋大楼后面后消失，当局因此失去了它的踪迹。

;0x52C2B8A1=He's setting up a task force with a web site and Bleeter page to ensure things happen quickly to get everything back on track in an all out assault on government action. Lawton looked compassionate but strong and promised to continue to improve the country, reduce taxes, punish foreigners and increase government spending in most areas, but sensibly and with one eye on what America is and another on what it could become. He received a standing ovation for the speech. We will stay with this fluff piece our owner made us run.

;0xC6D96603=Citizens are growing increasingly tired of being told to be scared shitless. "It really wears on me," 34 year old Broker resident Hamil Hajaj said.

In light of the recent attacks, many say they'd rather take their chances than deal with the congestion, inconvenience and loss of liberty that comes with a so-called safer community.
