;0x1869CCD3=A homeless Vietnam veteran, Jerry Kapowitz, has stumbled upon a haul of diamonds valued at over $2 million. They were in a small pouch amongst the trash in Meadows Park. Mr. Kapowitz had been living near the dump and surviving off of things he salvaged from there. "Before this, the best thing I'd found was a TV and that didn't even work," he told reporters. Mr. Kapowitz plans to take his newfound wealth down to Vice City where he will start a gun shop and liquor store, "They're real men down there and they need real guns and liquor in one convenient location." Mr. Kapowitz's ownership of the diamonds was immediately contested by over 100 people. Mayor Ochoa decided that it would be impossible to verify the claims so allowed Mr. Kapowitz to keep all of the proceeds from the diamonds' sale.
0x1869CCD3=Jerry Kapowitz，一位无家可归的越战老兵，如今被卷入了一起大量非法钻石事件中，涉案金额超200万美元。这些钻石被装进袋子里，然后被扔在Meadows Park的垃圾堆中。Kapowitz先生长期以来都住在垃圾场附近，通过拾荒以维持生计。“在这之前，我能找到最好的东西是一台坏掉的电视”，他告诉记者。Kapowitz先生计划带上他的钻石到Vice City去，到那儿开一家枪店和酒馆，“Vice City那边的人都是狠角色，而且他们迫切需要方便地取得一些真正的火力和美酒。”对于Kapowitz先生对这些钻石的所有权，很快就有超100人进行抗议。Ochoa市长决定，鉴于不可能证实这些钻石的所有权问题，因此允许Kapowitz先生保留钻石并可以进行交易。

;0x74693DD5=Mob Boss, Jon Gravelli, alleged head of the Gambetti crime family, died peacefully in his sleep last night. Mr. Gravelli, 85, had been residing at the Schottler Medical Center for the last 3 years. Although some in the DA's office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty.
0x74693DD5=Jon Gravelli，暴民头目，自称犯罪家族Gambetti的家主，于昨晚在睡梦中安然离世，享年85岁。Gravelli先生已在Schottler Medical Center医院住院3年。尽管一些地方检察官称那只是为了避免庭审的诡计，但Gravelli先生在住院后也从未走出过医院。Gravelli先生于1978年成为Gambetti家族犯罪集团的头目，在他的任职期内，该家族成为了Liberty City所有犯罪家族中最强大的一家，其最大的对手为Pavano家族。尽管被数次指证，但Gravelli先生从未被控告过一起严重犯罪事件。有的人认为他跟政府人员有所接触并受到保护，而他会为那些官员当打手或从事其他犯罪活动，但是这些指控却从未被证实。事到如今，Liberty City各个犯罪集团之间的微妙平衡该何去何从，一切都还是个未知数，但大概率也不会有多好就是了。

;0xD8EFD2CA=Authorities and pundits are looking for the meanings behind two gangland shootouts that broke out in the city. Several Russian gangsters thought to be involved in a major heroin deal were killed in Hove Beach. Shortly afterwards, a shootout broke out at Francis International Terminal, culminating in the crashing of a private jet belonging to controversial Russian business man Ray Bulgarin.
0xD8EFD2CA=官方人员和专家正在研究查明两个黑社会集团火并对这座城市造成的影响。数名涉嫌参与一起海洛因交易案件的俄国黑帮分子在Hove Beach被杀害。紧接着在Francis International Terminal中发生激烈枪战，并最终导致一架私人飞机坠毁，这架飞机属于一名备受争议的俄国商人Ray Bulgarin。

;0xEB2F7715=Attempting to read the tea leaves, as it were, authorities are asking whether this spells a resurgence in violent organised crime in the city, or perhaps its death knell. Are the numbers of these Russian criminals sustainable or will this infighting mean that they eventually become extinct? We shall see, but we certainly like the metaphor. Makes us look Darwinian.
0xEB2F7715=试图预测未来，就字面意思，官方人员正在思考这次事件是否意味着有组织暴力犯罪在这座城市里的死灰复燃，又或者是敲响了其死亡的丧钟。这些俄国黑帮犯罪分子将会持续存在吗，还是说经历这次帮派内讧意味着他们将最终灭亡？我们拭目以待。但是我们肯定喜欢这句隐喻：让我们看上去更“达尔文”一些吧。
