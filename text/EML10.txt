0x0DBF3EFD=你都不联系我，是忘了我的号码吗？也许是你打过来的时候我的手机没电了吧。这样感觉很怪。听好，时不时给我打个电话吧。很希望能和你一起出去玩。

;0xB4AD8CCF=Do you want to die alone, Luis, because I think you will. Seriously. You can't treat people like this. I mean who do you think you are? You an asshole and you're not that well endowed. I faked it. Why are you doing this to me? Seriously. Why?
0xB4AD8CCF=难道你想孤独终老吗，Luis？我觉得你会孤独终老的。老实说，你可不能这样对待他人。你以为自己是谁啊？你就是个混蛋，你的屌也没那么雄壮。被你干到高潮都是我装的。你为什么要这么对我？真的，为什么？

;0xB84B9417=What's up? or as you might say 'Yo, wassup!?' Still haven't heard much from you. I left a couple of messages. Maybe you didn't get them.
0xB84B9417=你好吗？或者按你说的「哟，咋的了！？」你还是没怎么联系我吧。我给你留了几条留言，好像你没收到。

;0xBA959E96=Whatever,
0xBA959E96=不管啦，

;0xBE77A063=Well, I'm sorry. I guess you never got the present I sent, because if you did and you haven't thanked me, that's just rude. I mean, seriously. Listen, I don't know what is wrong with you or whatever but come on. I mean, listen, I'm not a stalker or anything but I thought we kind of had a connection and in this crazy city, that means something.
0xBE77A063=好吧，我很遗憾。我猜你从没收到过我寄的礼物，要是你收到过却从未对我道谢，只能说你很没教养。坦白说，我不知道你哪根筋搭错了。听着，我不是想骚扰你的变态，但我觉得我俩真的有缘，而缘分在这座疯狂的城市里是很有价值的。

0xDCBDE2E6=再见，

;0xE73971F2=Anyway, me and some friends are meeting up later at the club. Maybe see you there? Be good to hang out. This guy is there who wants to date me and stuff but he's kind of annoying. Not like you. Apart from when you don't call back. Which is a bit rude. Seriously. I'm busy too. I've got a life. a good one. I'm hot. Anyway, see you later, maybe.
0xE73971F2=总之，我和一些朋友准备在夜店碰面。待会儿约吗？一起出去玩也挺好的。最近有个人想和我约会，但他有点烦人，不像你。不过在待人无礼这一点上，你不给我打电话也没好到哪去。讲道理，我也挺忙的，我有自己的生活，不错的生活。总之，稍后见啦，希望能见到你。
