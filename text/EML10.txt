0x0DBF3EFD=你都不联系我，难道你忘了我的号码吗？这么久都收不到你的来信，怪怪的，也许是我的手机没电了或者故障了吧。听好，时不时给我打个电话吧，我们一起出去浪一浪是极好的。

0xB4AD8CCF=Luis，难道你想孤独终老吗？我觉得你会的。老实说，你可不能这样对待他人。你以为自己是谁啊？你就是个混蛋，你可没有那么天赋异禀。我受够了，你为什么要这么对我？我很认真的，为什么？

;0xBE77A063=Well, I'm sorry. I guess you never got the present I sent, because if you did and you haven't thanked me, that's just rude. I mean, seriously. Listen, I don't know what is wrong with you or whatever but come on. I mean, listen, I'm not a stalker or anything but I thought we kind of had a connection and in this crazy city, that means something.
0xBE77A063=好吧，我很遗憾，我猜你从没收到我寄的礼物，因为你从未说一声谢谢，很没礼貌。坦白讲，我不知道你哪根筋搭错了。听着，我不是骚扰之类的，但我们在这么一座如此疯狂的城市里还能有所联系，这对我来说确实意味什么。

;0xE73971F2=Anyway, me and some friends are meeting up later at the club. Maybe see you there? Be good to hang out. This guy is there who wants to date me and stuff but he's kind of annoying. Not like you. Apart from when you don't call back. Which is a bit rude. Seriously. I'm busy too. I've got a life. a good one. I'm hot. Anyway, see you later, maybe.
0xE73971F2=总之，我和一些朋友准备在俱乐部碰面，也许我能在那儿看看你？出来玩玩也是挺好的，我的伙计总想和我约会之类的，否则就会有些恼火。不像你一样，不回我电话啊，这真的有点不礼貌。认真讲，我也挺忙的，我有自己的生活，不错的生活。总之，稍后见啦。
