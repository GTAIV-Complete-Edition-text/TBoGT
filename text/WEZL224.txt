;0x86568D0C=Close the bridges. Now. Despite the pleas of many citizens and this newspaper, the police bowed to liberals and reopened the bridges. And look what we've got. A spate of recent violence and what are surely terrorist attacks. Without rules, people will die.

0x86568D0C=立刻关闭大桥。快。尽管许多市民以及本报都请愿关闭大桥，警方最终还是向自由派低头，重新开放了大桥。而这就是开放大桥的后果：一系列暴力事件和恐怖袭击。若无秩序，人命如纸。专家表示，如今要想保证国民安全，只能采取以下手段：广泛安装监控摄像头、机场增加安保人数、地铁站强制安检以及对落户人口进行背景调查。
