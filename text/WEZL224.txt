;0x86568D0C=Close the bridges. Now. Despite the pleas of many citizens and this newspaper, the police bowed to liberals and reopened the bridges. And look what we've got. A spate of recent violence and what are surely terrorist attacks. Without rules, people will die.

0x86568D0C=我们需要马上关闭大桥。尽管有许多市民，包括本报社都请愿关闭大桥，警方最终还是向自由派低头，重新开放大桥的通行。看看我们得到了什么：一系列的暴力事件和恐怖袭击事件。若无秩序，人命如纸。专家表示，现在能做的无非只是：给机场加些监控、安保，在地铁站搜下包，以及对公寓展开背景调查。
