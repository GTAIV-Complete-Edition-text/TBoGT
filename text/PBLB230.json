            "original": "The 80s were the decade for men. Explosions, international drug running, open shirts that exposed chest hair, freedom to smoke during business meetings. The 2000's are the age of women. It's all waxing, complaining, and gossip. It's little wonder that Jack Howitzers abominable reality show is in the toilet. Our nation is no longer entertained by machismo garbage. Network executives say women are in charge of the remote control, and that they are forcing their men to watch home renovation shows and fashion makeover programs starring catty feminine men and no-nonsense women. We believe this trend will continue, while men focus on day spas and practicing yoga in a 150 degree room.",
            "translated": "80年代是属于男性的十年：爆炸，跨国贩毒，胸毛外露的开胸衬衫，商务场合随意吸烟。而新世纪的头十年则是女性的时代了，街头巷尾充斥着脱毛、抱怨和八卦新闻。正因如此，Jack Howitzer的垃圾真人秀会烂在下水道里也不奇怪了。我国国民已不再中意这些大男子主义的糟粕。许多电视台的高管表示，现在女人把持着遥控器，强迫大老爷们观看由娘娘腔和干练女性主演的家装节目和时装节目。鉴于现代男性会把大量精力放在日间水疗和高温瑜伽上，我们相信这一趋势还会持续下去。",
