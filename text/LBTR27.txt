;0x8D133C9D=These are just some of the words that our editors thought would lead you into reading this story. But they are also words that could be used to describe how local recently graduated workers feel about Liberty City companies who are taking advantage of them. Sandra McColland has filed a lawsuit that sets a new standard for workers. After collapsing on the job in what she describes as a work/life balance, McColland is fighting for all Liberty City businesses to allow 2 months paid vacation a year, flexible hours, yoga a flotation/isolation chamber spa on site. Local businesses complain about a generation that wasn't required to work in high school, received an allowance, had college and a condo paid for, and then expect the same from the workforce.

;0xCD6D6CD9=Rosenburg's attorney told Weazel News that his client now regularly devours a stuffed Pollo Toto Frito, a jar of mayonnaise, three pizzas and a plate of chocolate brownies covered in ranch sauce. He's lost his wallet seventeen times in the last month, developed an obsession with iconic bands of the 1970s and has started expressing increasingly left-wing political views. This is a landmark case and, if Rosenburg is awarded damages, predatory law firms are gearing up to get a class action suit against God, who created weed in the first place.
