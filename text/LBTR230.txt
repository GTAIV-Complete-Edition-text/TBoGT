;0x462CE244=A man was killed on the subway when an angry mob took exception to his refusal to stop playing air guitar while he listened to his mp3 player. After repeated requests to stop annoying everybody, the man was turned on by a mob and ripped apart. Passersby cheered as both locals and tourists ripped the man into shreds and scattered bloody remains all over the carriage. Witnesses spoke of a happy, festive atmosphere amongst the mob which is thought to have included three nuns, two teachers and a mother of six. Such was the state of the victim that police where unable to identify him and are asking for help.

Notorious bridge and tunnel mecca, dance club Bahama Mamma's, was recently the site of a violent shootout that left several dead including club owner Vic Manzano.

;0xD73EF357=Manzano was being investigated by the FIB for his links with organised crime in Liberty City and Las Venturas. He was also thought to be in a spat with members of the Ancellotti Crime Syndicate. Authorities are investigating these leads as possible motivations for the mass shooting. Meanwhile a group of Algonquin residents is lobbying the Civic Citadel to reclose the bridges to keep the bridge and tunnel menace out.

;0xDF78E108=Is there any celebrity with a shred of dignity left? Another middle aged has-been has decided to humiliate himself. Jack Howitzer's recently launched reality show is a ratings disaster, which has the writers and producers scrambling for some unplanned drama to unfold. Rumors abound that a reunion of Howitzer and Ho Chi is in the works, in which Howitzer breaks down and cries after apologizing for the sexual advances that broke up the duo. Desperate, but it might just work.
