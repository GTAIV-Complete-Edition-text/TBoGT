;0xBF54ABC2=Sweatshops. That's what the ragged, broken American college student finds when they hit the workforce. Fresh out of college, a place of learning, they want time to balance life by taking long hikes, getting colon cleansing, writing in a journal! How do we expect people to be part of a democracy when they are bogged down by oppressive work 8-9 hours a day? We feel sad for Sandra McColland, she's standing up for herself and fighting corporate America. Good for you. You go girl. These conservatives will take every ounce of your being. Sue them till they get a clue that work is about more than working.
0xBF54ABC2=血汗工厂，是广大落魄的美国大学生加入劳动大军时所遇到的。刚从大学这个学习知识的天地初出茅庐，他们需要时间去靠长途远足、清洗结肠、写日记来平衡生活！人们深陷于每天八到九个小时的强制工作时，我们怎么敢想让大家参与到民主事业中来？我们为Sandra McColland感到悲壮，她与美国企业斗争，为自己维权。你真棒。去吧，妹子。这帮保守党们会把你的一针一线都拿走。把他们都告上法庭，直到他们意识到工作不仅仅是干活那么简单。
