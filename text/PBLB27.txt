;0xBF54ABC2=Sweatshops. That's what the ragged, broken American college student finds when they hit the workforce. Fresh out of college, a place of learning, they want time to balance life by taking long hikes, getting colon cleansing, writing in a journal! How do we expect people to be part of a democracy when they are bogged down by oppressive work 8-9 hours a day? We feel sad for Sandra McColland, she's standing up for herself and fighting corporate America. Good for you. You go girl. These conservatives will take every ounce of your being. Sue them till they get a clue that work is about more than working.
0xBF54ABC2=广大落魄的美国大学生加入劳动大军时所遇到的，是血汗工厂。刚从大学这片知识天地毕业的他们，需要时间远足、洗肠、写日记，借此平来衡生活！如果人们被每天八九个小时的强制劳动绑架，他们还怎么参与到民主社会当中？Sandra McColland为自己发声，并与美国企业界进行抗争，我们为她的遭遇感到难过。你真行，加油姑娘。这些保守派会榨干你的每分每毫。起诉他们，让他们认清劳动不仅仅是干活。
