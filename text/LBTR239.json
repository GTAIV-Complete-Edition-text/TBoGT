Men won't bring women to a war or robot movie, but women will drag their men to a romantic comedy. And the men will shove his face full of expensive food from the snack stand just to make it through the film.\" Experts say it's a phenomenon they don't yet have a theory but isn't it worthy of a major government study as it seems really important?",

The One-Eyed Sailor, a neighborhood dive bar for over 50 years, has been overrun with hipsters in recent months following a blog post that described it as, \"undiscovered, counter-cultural and uber-raw.\" Jude Corbin, age 32, had been running up a tab on his parents' credit card with six or seven other identically-dressed, bearded 20-somethings since the early afternoon. The group spent a few hours loudly debating the type of bagel that best defines their identity, while slouching outside every five minutes to nonchalantly smoke clove cigarettes. As they became increasingly drunk, however, tensions with the regular customers began to build. When they started playing 80s music on the juke box and ironically body-popping, their patronizing fauxhemian antics proved too much for one local man, who dragged Corbin outside by his asymmetrical bangs and proceeded to beat him on the sidewalk, shouting, \"Go back home you ridiculous hipster scum,\". Corbin's friends ran off immediately, leaving the 90-pound, wannabe Beat Poet at the mercy of his 250-pound assailant. Witnesses say that he curled up into a ball, crying like a baby, and died a few seconds later when his skintight corduroys cut off the blood flow to the brain.",
