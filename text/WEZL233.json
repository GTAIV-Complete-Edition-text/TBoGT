The crane accident at the libel site on Columbus Avenue could be prevented if unions didn't have such a stranglehold on the construction industry in this town. And the transit union is to blame for the awful derailment of the subway train on the Algonquin-Bohan line. For the trifecta, if union airport security gaurds actually did some work instead of putting us all at risk with their 4 hour work days, long lunches and lazy work ethic, the explosion at Francis International wouldn't have happened. How many more innocent Americans will die because of unions? Weazel News will keep you informed.",
