;0x77E5DCF4=A 32-year-old budding artist was viciously beaten to death last night outside a bar in East Hook. Fueled by the pressures of the economic downturn, this is the latest in a spate of revenge attacks by long-standing Broker residents, who believe that their neighborhoods have been ruined by an influx of bearded, over-privileged rich kids in fedoras. While we of course sympathize wholeheartedly and hyperbolically with the plight of poor, ethnic communities, whose futures have been gambled away by President Lawton on war games and big business subsidies, we can and will never condone hate. Hipsterphobia is prejudice like any other and they must be defended, especially as they make up the lion's share of our reader base.
0x77E5DCF4=一个刚刚崭露头角的的32岁艺术家于昨晚在East Hook的一家酒吧外被恶意殴打致死。这是最新一起在经济下行压力推动下，由久居Broker区的居民发动的报复行动——他们认为自己的街区被涌入该区的一伙留着络腮胡戴着费多拉帽还富得流油的小鬼们给毁了。尽管如此，我们依然万分同情这些深陷困境的贫困种族社区，因为他们的未来已经被Lawton总统拿去当作他那些战争游戏和高额商业补贴的筹码并最终输得一干二净，对此我们永远，永远不会原谅。时髦恐惧症与其他的偏见并无二致，因此他们必须被捍卫，尤其是当这些人还构成了我们读者群体基数的最大头的时候。

;0x894F7FC7=So they believe that they are unique and countercultural by dressing in exactly the same clothes? So they ride fixed-gear bicycles and live off their parents' money? So they seek to escape their privileged upbringings and middle-class guilt by expropriating the cultures and fashions of the working class and turning them into kitsch for their own amusement? So they are pitiful, insecure, pretentious, snarky, narcissistic, pasty-faced pseudo-slackers whom the world would be better off without? Are these reasons to hate them? Er, maybe. I don't know any more. I'm incapable of stating an opinion for fear that I might offend somebody. But, if I learned one thing from my Liberal Arts degree, it is this: stereotypes are bad. Never put a label on anything unless it contains animal fats.
0x894F7FC7=所以哪怕穿着完全一样的衣服，他们依然相信自己特殊而又反文化是吗？所以他们骑着死飞靠啃老为生是吗？所以他们指望着通过夺走工人阶级的文化和潮流并以将它们贬为媚俗为乐的方式来摆脱他们处处养尊处优的成长经历以及中产阶级罪恶感是吗？所以他们是可悲，不稳定，自命不凡，善于嚣叫，自我陶醉，面色苍白的虚伪懒鬼，是如果没了他们这个世界会变得更美好的那种人是吗？所以这些就是憎恨他们的理由是吗？呃，或许吧。我现在已经说不准了。我对自己如今发表观点时因为害怕得罪别人而畏首畏尾的表现无能为力。然而，如果说我真的有从我的文科学位里学到什么的话，那就是：因固于己见而墨守陈规是不好的。除非这玩意儿里含有动物脂肪，否则永远不要试图给任何东西贴标签。
