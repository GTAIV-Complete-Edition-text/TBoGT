;0x9629B7C6=I hope you are doing better than when we last spoke. Listen, I won't waste time on pleasantries. I am sure your life as a pimp and drug pusher and night club man is great, but you are killing Ma. She is worried sick and quite frankly, I've had about enough. When the kids' break up for school, I've got half a mind to come there and give you a piece of my mind.

;0xC36B34A0=Ernesto! My dear brother! I hope being an accountant is still as much fun as ever! Man you are so lucky! Looking at columns of numbers all day. I miss you, bro. I really do. But since you left town and don't send Momma no money, I'm about all she got left. Now, I ain't perfect, but at least I actually seen my momma in the last five years. You call her up twice a year, then shout at me, then disappear back to suburbia. So, please, go fuck yourself. I know your tight ass wife ain't giving you none, although she try to get it on with me. Your loving brother, Luis.

But Ma needs better than what you give her. So that's why I am emailing. So sort yourself out, or you will have me to answer to.
