However, industry insiders say they haven't had a plan for a video shoot in months.

;0x746C2893=You may have heard the nonsense coming out of Switzerland this week - no, not their claims that pocket knives and watches are a really important contribution to global culture - but the economists' summit that declared the recession is in fact just a myth. Millions of Americans disagree - in fact one in 7 does so because they're unemployed. Economists are idiots who sit around drawing graphs and getting aroused at comparing GDP numbers from year to year. They were dorks at school who still cannot get laid. We say - Babylon is burning, and nobody cares except a few of us journalists left since all the papers have gone down the shitter. I was an intern last week and now I'm Sr. Economics editor. Journalism is screwed. Big shout outs to my boys Javier and Jason. You know how we do it in Bohan, son! Peace!
0x746C2893=你或许已经听说这周瑞士方面传来一些胡说的消息——不，不是指他们关于瑞士刀和瑞士表对全球文化做出巨大贡献的说辞——而是在经济峰会上宣称目前的经济衰退情况依然处于迷雾之中。广大美国人民坚决不同意这一说法——事实上7个中就有1个不同意，因为他被解雇了。那些经济学家不过是一群干坐在那画画图表、光是对着历年来的GDP数据比来比去就高潮了的白痴罢了。他们就是一群没破处的书呆子。我们常说，事不关己高高挂起，除非所有报社都陷入这场灾难破事中，导致我们记者中的一部分跳槽。我上周还是一个实习生，而现在却成了Sr. Economics的编辑。新闻业玩完了。特别感谢我的好兄弟Javier和Jason。你知道我们在Bohan是怎么干的，伙计们！和平！

;0xAC0938BE=Mr. Van Hardenburg was loved by some and hated by many who accused him of being involved in all manner of nefarious activities. Having been accused at various points of arms dealing, drug trafficking, slave trading, incest, and supporting repressive regimes, some will not mourn his passing, but many in government enjoyed vacations at his ranch and hunting endangered species on his farm.
0xAC0938BE=Mr. Van Hardenburg有人爱，但有更多人恨，因为后者都指控他参与各式各样的罪恶活动。由于被指控涉及参与军火交易、毒品贩运、奴隶贸易、强奸乱伦以及支持反动极端势力统治，有的人对他的离世根本不屑任何哀悼，但政府官员们倒是很喜欢在他的大牧场享受假期，一边还在他的农场里狩猎濒危物种。
