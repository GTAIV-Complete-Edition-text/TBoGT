;0x3EBBF831=Pressing the wrong button on his phone may cost him millions of dollars as fans react to the scandalous shots of boy band superstar Bobby Blue in women's lingerie posing and mugging in the mirror. Mr. Blue initially claimed it was a digitally altered photo that had been sent out by a rival boy band. Now he's confessed all and says he dressed up for a funny shoot for their next video. However, industry insiders say they haven't had a plan for a video shoot in months.

;0x746C2893=You may have heard the nonsense coming out of Switzerland this week - no, not their claims that pocket knives and watches are a really important contribution to global culture - but the economists' summit that declared the recession is in fact just a myth. Millions of Americans disagree - in fact one in 7 does so because they're unemployed. Economists are idiots who sit around drawing graphs and getting aroused at comparing GDP numbers from year to year. They were dorks at school who still cannot get laid. We say - Babylon is burning, and nobody cares except a few of us journalists left since all the papers have gone down the shitter. I was an intern last week and now I'm Sr. Economics editor. Journalism is screwed. Big shout outs to my boys Javier and Jason. You know how we do it in Bohan, son! Peace!
0x746C2893=你或许听说了本周来自瑞士的无稽之谈。不，不是「瑞士军刀和手表对全球文化有巨大贡献」，而是经济峰会上的所谓「经济衰退纯属捏造」。广大美国人民都不同意——事实上每七人中就有一名失业者。经济学家不过是一群成天坐着画图表、对着历年GDP数据比来比去就能高潮的白痴罢了。他们就是一群没破处的书呆子。要我们说，巴比伦正在倾倒，但除了我们几个记者以外没有人在乎，因为各个报社都要倒闭了。上周我还是实习生，现在已经是经济新闻部的高级编辑了。新闻业玩完了。特别感谢我的好兄弟Javier和Jason。你知道我们在Bohan是怎么干的，伙计们！再见！

;0xAC0938BE=Mr. Van Hardenburg was loved by some and hated by many who accused him of being involved in all manner of nefarious activities. Having been accused at various points of arms dealing, drug trafficking, slave trading, incest, and supporting repressive regimes, some will not mourn his passing, but many in government enjoyed vacations at his ranch and hunting endangered species on his farm.
0xAC0938BE=Van Hardenburg先生受到部分人推崇，但也被部分人仇视，指控他犯下了种种罪行。由于被控涉嫌参与军火交易、毒品贩运、奴隶贸易、强奸乱伦以及支持专制政权，有些人不会对他的离世表示哀悼，但许多政府官员曾在他的大牧场享受假期，还在他的农场狩猎过濒危动物。
