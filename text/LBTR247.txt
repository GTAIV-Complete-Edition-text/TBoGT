;0x746C2893=You may have heard the nonsense coming out of Switzerland this week - no, not their claims that pocket knives and watches are a really important contribution to global culture - but the economists' summit that declared the recession is in fact just a myth. Millions of Americans disagree - in fact one in 7 does so because they're unemployed. Economists are idiots who sit around drawing graphs and getting aroused at comparing GDP numbers from year to year. They were dorks at school who still cannot get laid. We say - Babylon is burning, and nobody cares except a few of us journalists left since all the papers have gone down the shitter. I was an intern last week and now I'm Sr. Economics editor. Journalism is screwed. Big shout outs to my boys Javier and Jason. You know how we do it in Bohan, son! Peace!

Having been accused at various points of arms dealing, drug trafficking, slave trading, incest, and supporting repressive regimes, some will not mourn his passing, but many in government enjoyed vacations at his ranch and hunting endangered species on his farm.
