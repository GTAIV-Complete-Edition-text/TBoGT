;0x451370DD=Romantic comedies are all the rage at the box office these days as Vinewood changes course from the macho to the metrosexual. It's been a long time coming. Elisabeth Lanclett, a spokesperson for Liberty City Cinemas said business is booming. "We love the trend of romantic comedies. Men won't bring women to a war or robot movie, but women will drag their men to a romantic comedy. And the men will shove his face full of expensive food from the snack stand just to make it through the film." Experts say it's a phenomenon they don't yet have a theory but isn't it worthy of a major government study as it seems really important?

;0xC911E4F5=A fight outside a bar in Broker's East Hook neighborhood ended in death and carnage last night. The One-Eyed Sailor, a neighborhood dive bar for over 50 years, has been overrun with hipsters in recent months following a blog post that described it as, "undiscovered, counter-cultural and uber-raw." Jude Corbin, age 32, had been running up a tab on his parents' credit card with six or seven other identically-dressed, bearded 20-somethings since the early afternoon. The group spent a few hours loudly debating the type of bagel that best defines their identity, while slouching outside every five minutes to nonchalantly smoke clove cigarettes. As they became increasingly drunk, however, tensions with the regular customers began to build. When they started playing 80s music on the juke box and ironically body-popping, their patronizing fauxhemian antics proved too much for one local man, who dragged Corbin outside by his asymmetrical bangs and proceeded to beat him on the sidewalk, shouting, "Go back home you ridiculous hipster scum,". Corbin's friends ran off immediately, leaving the 90-pound, wannabe Beat Poet at the mercy of his 250-pound assailant. Witnesses say that he curled up into a ball, crying like a baby, and died a few seconds later when his skintight corduroys cut off the blood flow to the brain.
0xC911E4F5=一场战斗在布鲁克东区的酒吧外面发生了，并且最终演变成了一场大屠杀，数人死亡。“一眼水手”，这个街区超过50年的历史之久的一个非主流酒吧，但是在一篇博客里面夸大的将其描述为“不被发现的，反文化的，并且极度嬉皮风格的”，并且这些描述在嬉皮士群体中广为流传。Jude Corbin，32岁，一直在用自己父母的信用卡贩毒，从下午刚开始就有六七个穿着一模一样，留着胡子的20多岁的孩子。这群人花了几个小时激烈的辩论哪一种百吉饼能代表他们的身份，并且他们每五分钟在外面懒洋洋地抽一次丁香烟。然而正当他们变得越来越醉的时候，与老顾客的关系开始紧张起来。他们开始在自动点唱机播放80年代的音乐并且十分讽刺的弹跳，对一个当地人来说，他们光顾的费希米滑稽动作实在太过分了，他用不对称的刘海把科尔宾拖到外面，然后在人行道上殴打他，大声喊道，“回家吧，你这个可笑的时髦人渣，”。科尔宾的朋友们立刻跑掉了，把这位重达90磅、想要殴打的诗人交给了重达250磅的袭击者。目击者说，他蜷缩成一个球，哭得像个婴儿，几秒钟后死亡，他的紧身灯芯绒衣服上沾满了流向大脑的血液。
